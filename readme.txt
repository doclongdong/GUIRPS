## GUI Runner for PowerShell (GUIRPS)

A simple way to optionally launch multiple programs at once with a GUI, for example on startup. Written in powershell.

Why make this?


- `shell:startup` lauches programs non-selectively. Everything in there boots every time.
- Usually more convenient for selectively launching a handful of programs than clicking desktop icons on boot,  especially if you have many icons and say, 5 programs to launch.


#### Use case:

U have 5 programs. 80% of the time, you want 1 and 2 to launch. The other 10% of the time, you want 3-5 to launch. The remaining 10% you either want all 5 to launch or none to launch.

Launching these combinations of programs with desktop icons is surprisingly clunky and slow, especially if you have a lot of clutter on the desktop.
Launching them with windows key + typing is also a pain in the ass.
